### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### What's going on.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a custom terminal homepage for my laptop (Which is cross-compatible with all 4 of the OS I have on my laptop: Windows 11, Ubuntu, Debian, ChromeOS: Through brunch)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about pretty much anything to do with Python and Linux commands
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love coding. (Not really anything unexpected!)
